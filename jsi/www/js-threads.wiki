<title>Threads</title>
Threads are supported in Jsi, each interp can have only a one thread.

This means that thread support is only available by creating threads with the option <b>{subthread:true}</b>.

This is used in conjunction with Events to multitask a single Jsi program.

For more details, see [./js-interp.wiki|Interp#threads].
